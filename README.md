# Chainspace documentation

This is the Chainspace platform's documentation. It's built using `hugo` (install instructions for your platform are at https://gohugo.io/).

## Building the site

Execute `hugo` from the top-level folder and the site will build. `hugo serve` gives you a hot-reloading webserver running the docs on http://localhost:1313.
