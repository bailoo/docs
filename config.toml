 # This may or may not work in a subfolder once deployed at e.g. http://chainspace.io/docs.
 # See https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/issue-when-baseurl-have-subdirectory/4088/7.
 # So we may still have some interesting times ahead. Simple answer would be to
 # use "https://docs.chainspace.io" but subfolder's probably better for SEO.
 # Don't attempt to use https://chainspace.io/docs here, it'll appear to work
 # until you restart the Hugo server, at which point you'll get a blank page.
 #
 # For the moment I have hacked it: there's a `deploy` branch in the repo,
 # set to /docs. The `master` branch is still set to "/". Gross but effective.
