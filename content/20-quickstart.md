# Quickstart

* Install Go 1.11. Earlier versions won't work.
* `git clone` the code into the source dir of your `$GOPATH`, typically `~/go/src`
* `make install`
* `make contract`

### Setting Up and Running Nodes

The `chainspace init <networkname>` command, by default, creates a network consisting of 12 nodes grouped into 3 shards of 4 nodes each.

The setup you get from that is heavily skewed towards convenient development rather than production use. It will change as we get closer to production.

Have a look at the config files for the network you've generated (stored by default in `~/.chainspace/<networkname>`). The `network.yaml` file contains public signing keys and transport encryption certificates for each node in the network. Everything in `network.yaml` is public, and for the moment it defines network topology. Later, it will be replaced by a directory component.

Each node also gets its own named configuration directory, containing:

* public and private signing and transport encryption keys for each node
* a node configuration file
* log output

In the default setup, nodes 1, 4, 7, and 10 comprise shard 1. Run those node numbers if you're only interested in seeing consensus working. Otherwise, start all nodes to see sharding working as well.

```bash
rm -rf ~/.chainspace # destroy any old configs, make you sad in production
chainspace init foonet
chainspace run foonet 1
chainspace run foonet 4
chainspace run foonet 7
chainspace run foonet 10
```

A convenient script runner is included. The short way to run it is:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.chainspace # clear previous configs, superbad idea in production
chainspace init foonet
script/run-testnet foonet
```

This will fire up a single shard which runs consensus, and make it available for use.

## REST Documentation

Many parts of the system are available to poke at via a RESTful HTTP server interface. After starting a node locally, you can see what's available by going to http://localhost:9001/swagger/index.html - where `9001` is the node's HTTP server port as defined in `~/.chainspace/<network-name>/node-X/node.yaml`

## Peer Discovery

We have not yet implemented seed nodes, or a cryptographically secure method of peer discovery. This is for future development and the details aren't yet clear (although we're working on it). So we have implemented some simple methods for stitching together networks until we are ready to commit to a final system.

Nodes currently find each other in two ways:

1. mDNS discovery
1. registry

### mDNS discovery

In development or on private networks, nodes can discover each other using mDNS broadcast. This allows zero-configuration setups for nodes that are all on the same subnet.

Use the Registry when configuring nodes across the public internet. We run a public registry at https://registry.chainspace.io

You can run your own Registry if you want. Init your network with the `--registry` flag if you plan to use a Registry server:

```bash
chainspace init foonet --registry registry.chainspace.io
```

The Registry will then appear in each node's `node.yaml`:

```yaml
registries:
- host: registry.chainspace.io
- token: 05b16f5d45377baff52c25e2c154a00b126f7b75b7345794d3e15535b49a03f955b9c355
```

The randomly-generated registry `token` ensures that unique shared secret is used on a per-network basis so that multiple networks can share the same registry without any additional setup.

Nodes will automatically register themselves with the network's registry server when they start up.

It is possible to use both the Registry and mDNS discovery at the same time.

## Sending Transactions To Consensus

At the moment, there is no externally-exposed network interface for using the consensus component by itself. You can however access it programmatically using Go, e.g.

```go
import "chainspace.io/prototype/node"

s, err := node.Run(cfg)
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}
s.Broadcast.AddTransaction(txdata, fee)
```

[DAVE TODO: check that code can actually run]
[TODO: build out a Blockmania HTTP API endpoint that can accept transactions and order them]

## Consensus Load Generator

The `chainspace genload <networkname> <nodenumber>` command starts up the specified node, and additionally a client which floods the consensus interface (in Go) with simulated transactions (100 bytes by default).

To get some consensus performance numbers, run this in 4 separate terminals:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.chainspace
chainspace init foonet
chainspace genload foonet 1
chainspace genload foonet 4
chainspace genload foonet 7
chainspace genload foonet 10
```

The client keeps increasing load until it detects that the node is unable to handle the transaction rate, based on timing drift when waking up to generate epochs. At that point the client backs off, and in general a stable equilibrium is reached. The `genload` console logs then report on average, current, and highest transactions per second throughput.

A convenient script runner is included. The short way to run it is:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.chainspace
chainspace init foonet
script/genload-testnet foonet
```

This will start nodes 1, 4, 7 and 10 in `tmux` terminals, pumping transactions through automatically.

*NOTE: to get valid results, turn off all other applications when doing performance testing. Also disable swap on your system, turn off CPI BIOS thermal controls, disable power management, and don't run it on battery power.*

Running `chainspace genload` with swap enabled can cause system lockups on Linux, as the system thinks much more RAM is available than is in fact the case, write latencies increase drastically once swapping starts, and the system freaks out. `sudo swapoff -a` is your friend, with `sudo swapon -a` to get your swap back when you're done running Chainspace.

## Key-Value Store

TODO: Add a description of what the Key Value store is and does, how it relates to SBAC, contracts, etc.

How to use the key value storage.

Prerequisites
-------------

* Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) for your platform
* Test that Docker is working. Run `docker run hello-world` in a shell. Fix any errors before proceeding.
* Set up a testnet

### Building the Key Value store

Build the docker image for your contracts, you can do this using the makefile at the root of the repository:

```
$ make contract
```
In the future chainspace will pull the docker image directly from a docker registry according to which contract is being run. At present during development we've simply hard-coded in a dummy contract inside a Docker container we've made.  

You may need to initialize the contract with your network: run `chainspace contracts <yournetworkname> create`. TODO: Jeremy under what conditions is this necessary?

Next, run the script `script/run-sharding-testnet`.
```
$ ./script/run-sharding-testnet 1
```

This script will:

* initialize a new chainspace network `testnet-sharding-1` with `1` shard.
* start the different contracts required by your network (by default only the dummy contract)
* start the nodes of your network

The generated configuration exposes a HTTP REST API on all nodes. Node 1 starts on port 8001, Node 2 on port 8002 and so on.

Seeding trial objects using httptest
------------------------------------

In order to test the key value store you can use the `httptest` binary (which is installed at the same time as the chainspace binary when you run `make install`).

```
$ httptest -addr "0.0.0.0:8001" -workers 1 -objects 3 -duration 20
```

This will run `httptest` for 20 seconds, with one worker creating 3 objects per transaction.

When it starts running you should see output like this on stdout:
```
seeding objects for worker 0 with 0.0.0.0:8001
new seed key: djEAAAAA7rrTmXyvwexDRbDXWAU4n/gJPBJOkB8BiXYe4+VKmaNHpYCMrXNVoA2Siiau+e9ouPOZOG5CNLhiCDQ2KAzU+9+36tPibLbBwYx/B7M9TpGbDgD7VBL5XakoVf87VQWx

creating new object with label: label:0:0
creating new object with label: label:0:1
creating new object with label: label:0:2
seeds generated successfully
```

This shows you the different labels which are created by the tests and associated to objects. You can then use these to get the id / value of your objects.

Retrieving objects
------------------

Call this http endpoint in order to retrieve the chainspace object's `versionId` associated to your label.
```
curl -v http://0.0.0.0:8001/kv/get-versionid -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"label": "label:0:1"}'
```

Call this http endpoint to retrieve the object associated to your label:
```
curl -v http://0.0.0.0:8001/kv/get -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"label": "label:0:1"}'
```

You can see that the `versionId` associated to your label evolves over time, when transactions are consuming them.


### Running the Key-Value Store with multiple shards

This should work fine, but there's a caveat. Objects will change their `versionId`s on each update, and currently we're sharding on `versionId`. So your object may appear to migrate between shards whenever you update it. We're working on our strategy to alleviate this.
