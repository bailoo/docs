# Key-Value Store

TODO: Add a description of what the Key Value store is and does, how it relates to SBAC, contracts, etc.

How to use the key value storage.

Prerequisites
-------------

* Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) for your platform
* Test that Docker is working. Run `docker run hello-world` in a shell. Fix any errors before proceeding.
* Set up a testnet

## Building

Build the docker image for your contracts, you can do this using the makefile at the root of the repository:

```
$ make contract
```
In the future chainspace will pull the docker image directly from a docker registry according to which contract is being run. At present during development we've simply hard-coded in a dummy contract inside a Docker container we've made.  

You may need to initialize the contract with your network: run `chainspace contracts <yournetworkname> create`. TODO: Jeremy under what conditions is this necessary?

Next, run the script `script/run-sharding-testnet`.
```
$ ./script/run-sharding-testnet 1
```

This script will:

* initialize a new chainspace network `testnet-sharding-1` with `1` shard.
* start the different contracts required by your network (by default only the dummy contract)
* start the nodes of your network

The generated configuration exposes a HTTP REST API on all nodes. Node 1 starts on port 8001, Node 2 on port 8002 and so on.

Seeding trial objects using httptest
------------------------------------

In order to test the key value store you can use the `httptest` binary (which is installed at the same time as the chainspace binary when you run `make install`).

```
$ httptest -addr "0.0.0.0:8001" -workers 1 -objects 3 -duration 20
```

This will run `httptest` for 20 seconds, with one worker creating 3 objects per transaction.

When it starts running you should see output like this on stdout:
```
seeding objects for worker 0 with 0.0.0.0:8001

creating new object with label: label:0:0
creating new object with label: label:0:1
creating new object with label: label:0:2
seeds generated successfully
```

This shows you the different labels which are created by the tests and associated to objects. You can then use these to get the id / value of your objects.

Retrieving objects
------------------

Call this http endpoint in order to retrieve the chainspace object's `versionId` associated to your label.
```
curl -v http://0.0.0.0:8001/kv/get-versionid -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"label": "label:0:1"}'
```

Call this http endpoint to retrieve the object associated to your label:
```
curl -v http://0.0.0.0:8001/kv/get -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"label": "label:0:1"}'
```

You can see that the `versionId` associated to your label evolves over time, when transactions are consuming them.


## With multiple shards

Running the Key-Value store with multiple shards should work fine, but there's a caveat. Objects will change their `versionId`s on each update, and currently we're sharding on `versionId`. So if you're retrieving using `versionId`, your object may appear to migrate between shards whenever you update it. If you retrieve your object by `label` instead, you should be able to retrieve it, but only if you know which shard it's living in. TODO: this interacts with the planned Directory component.
