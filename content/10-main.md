# Introduction

Chainspace is a smart contract system offering speedy consensus and unlimited horizontal scalability.

At present, our running code has two main components:

* the `sbac` is a sharding component. It provides an implementation of the Sharded Byzantine Atomic Commit (S-BAC) protocol detailed in the [Chainspace](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03778) academic paper.
* the consensus component, which implements the leaderless consensus protocol detailed in the [Blockmania](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01620) paper.

Eventually, it's likely that we will split these two components. A project wanting only fast consensus, but no sharding, should be able use Blockmania by itself. For projects that need the added horizontal scalability of sharding, the S-BAC component would be added. But for the moment, the two components co-exist in the same codebase.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```go
package main

import "github.com/bep/kittn/auth"

func main() {
	api := auth.Authorize("meowmeowmeow")

	// Just to make it compile
	_ = api
}
```

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.

# Kittens

## Get All Kittens

```go
package main

import "github.com/bep/kittn/auth"

func main() {
	api := auth.Authorize("meowmeowmeow")

	_ = api.GetKittens()
}
```

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
api.kittens.get
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
api.kittens.get()
```

```shell
curl "http://example.com/api/kittens"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
let kittens = api.kittens.get();
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Fluffums",
    "breed": "calico",
    "fluffiness": 6,
    "cuteness": 7
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Max",
    "breed": "unknown",
    "fluffiness": 5,
    "cuteness": 10
  }
]
```

This endpoint retrieves all kittens.

### HTTP Request

`GET http://example.com/api/kittens`

### Query Parameters

Parameter | Default | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------
include_cats | false | If set to true, the result will also include cats.
available | true | If set to false, the result will include kittens that have already been adopted.

<aside class="success">
Remember â€” a happy kitten is an authenticated kitten!
</aside>

## Get a Specific Kitten

```go
package main

import "github.com/bep/kittn/auth"

func main() {
	api := auth.Authorize("meowmeowmeow")

	_ = api.GetKitten(2)
}
```

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
api.kittens.get(2)
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
api.kittens.get(2)
```

```shell
curl "http://example.com/api/kittens/2"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
let max = api.kittens.get(2);
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "name": "Max",
  "breed": "unknown",
  "fluffiness": 5,
  "cuteness": 10
}
```

This endpoint retrieves a specific kitten.
